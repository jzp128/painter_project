## Project Description

We aim to create an app that allows the users to draw images online. It would feature all functionalites that a paint program will have, and allow multiple users to collaborate on a drawing.

## Beta Goals

For the beta we aim to create the basic paint application, the user will be able to upload an svg file to edit or create a new one. When the user is done, they can save the file as a svg file or some other format of their choosing. If possible, the user could also store it in a cloud storage of their choice.

## Final Goals

The final product will allow the users to store the files on their account/storage of their choice, as well as allow for multiple people to work on an image at one time.

## Technologies
Our group is looking to use React for the frontend in order to quickly create the components for our drawing app. For editing & rendering the image we will potentially use [snap.svg](http://snapsvg.io/docs/) to help us work with svg files. For the collaborative portion we are curently still doing research on what websocket technology we are using, we will also likely use google drive api to allow the option for users to upload their files to Google Drive

## Challenges
1. Real time syncronization between multiple users working on a file
2. Creating editor that contains intuitive and easy to use tools for vector images
3. Rendering editing overlays (e.g rotation guides) over editors and tracking modifications 
4. Learning a new framework (React) While creating a project
5. Allowing users to upload and import from other sources
